starter in chunks knead for about 5

22
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.509
minutes the dough should be moderately

23

towards the center brushing away any raw

32
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.350
flour folding the zoo increases the

33
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.220
strength and elasticity of the dough

34
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.200

equal parts depending on the size of the

45
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.269
loaf you want usually the length of the

46
00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.820
baguette should be 60 to 65 centimetres

47
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.769
and four to six centimetres wide we made

48
00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.200
six baguettes of about 50 centimetres

piece of dough into a log tucking the

52
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.340
edges in and set aside now work with a

53
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.010
piece of dough you rolled first use one

54
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.170
hand to fold the further away from you

55
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.810
edge into the middle push it down with

56
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.019
the heel of your other hand turn the

57
00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.860
bill around and repeat the folding twice

lightly spray the towel with water to

65
00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.050
avoid formation of a crust on the

66
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.269

blade to score the baguettes make long

70
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.739

baking if not spray the oven with water
